        <div id="paragraph1" style="display: none">Hello there! My name is Amber and I am a registered nurse 
        turned front-end web developer. I've found that my passion lies closer to software development, but 
        luckily working in nursing has actually given me many skills that have helped in my journey to 
        transitioning into this profession. I find coding to be just as mentally stimulating as nursing in 
        terms of problem solving and paying attention to details, but I much prefer the creative aspect of 
        software development!</div>
        <div id="paragraph2" style="display: none">I have experience with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and I am 
        familiar with React.js. I have been building projects with them for about 6 months so far. I intend on 
        learning more programming languages and frameworks, and I want to also become even more proficient in 
        the languages I already know. As for soft skills, I am a detail-oriented person, well-organized, good 
        at problem-solving, professional, friendly to work with, patient, and reliable – all skills I have 
        expanded upon while working as a registered nurse previously.</div>
        <div id="paragraph3" style="display: none">I have yet to acquire my first coding job, but I am looking 
        forward to my eventual start! As far as previous work experience, I have worked in a variety of 
        environments which have been a big help in this dive into the world of coding. Besides the soft skills 
        that I mentioned in the “skills” section, I’ve also been able to pinpoint exactly how I learn things 
        quickly and efficiently - which made my experience with learning to code much easier. I know that it 
        will also help me greatly in this career when it comes to learning other programming languages down 
        the road.</div>
